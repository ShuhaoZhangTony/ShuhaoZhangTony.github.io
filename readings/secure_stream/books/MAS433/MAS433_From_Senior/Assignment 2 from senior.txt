1. TLS connections starts with a handshake before switching to secured communications after the handshake between the client and the server is successful. A handshake was never performed in SSL.

2. A public key certificate is an electronic document which uses a digital signature to bind together a public key  with an identity ?information such as the name of a person or an organization, their address, and so forth. The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual.

3. 1. The client sends a "Client hello" message to the server, along with the client's random value and supported cipher suites.
   2. The server responds by sending a "Server hello" message to the client, along with the server's random value.
   3. The server sends its certificate to the client for authentication and may request a certificate from the client. The server sends the "Server hello done" message.
   4. If the server has requested a certificate from the client, the client sends it.
   5. The client creates a random Pre-Master Secret and encrypts it with the public key from the server's certificate, sending the encrypted Pre-Master Secret to the server.
   6. The server receives the Pre-Master Secret. The server and client each generate the Master Secret and session keys based on the Pre-Master Secret.
   7. The client sends "Change cipher spec" notification to server to indicate that the client will start using the new session keys for hashing and encrypting messages. Client also sends "Client finished" message.
   8. Server receives "Change cipher spec" and switches its record layer security state to symmetric encryption using the session keys. Server sends "Server finished" message to the client.
   9. Client and server can now exchange application data over the secured channel they have established. All messages sent from client to server and from server to client are encrypted using session key.

4.2.1 TLS 1.0
4.2.2 TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA 

4.3.1 RSA public key cryptosystem, RC4 stream cipher and also Secure Hash Algorithm.
4.3.2 RSA, The Security Division of EMC.

4.5 RSA is used to generate the session keys used for the secure connection and also to establish identification during the handshake.

4.6 The client encrypts a random number (RN) with the server's public key (PbK), and sends the result to the server. Only the server should be able to decrypt it (with its private key (PvK)): this is the one fact that makes the keys hidden from third parties, since only the server and the client have access to this data. The client knows PbK and RN, and the server knows PvK and (after decryption of the client's message) RN. A third party is only able to know RN if PvK has been compromised.
