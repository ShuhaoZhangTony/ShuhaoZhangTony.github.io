Apart from the historyCEP, which introduce a little bit of the background of CEP system,

as of now, my paper review is categorized into following part:

1. **CEP architectures**: review all the main stream CEP system, including SASE, Cayuga, Zstream etc.

	>Then in order to explore the scalability of CEP system, I need to:

2. **CEPPartitioningTechniques.md**: this is focus on review the partitioning techniques proposed that try to solve the "Too high rate of data prospective" of scalability of CEP.
3. **MultiQueryCEP.md**: this is focus on review the technieques proposed that try to solve the "Too many queries prospective " of scalability of CEP.
4. **BatchCEP.md**: this is focus on a new strategy (Buffer/Batch Oriented) on CEP architecture.
	>**4.1 faultTolerant.md**: this is focus on what ideas have been proposed in order to solve the "Fault" problem caused by "after scaling out" the CEP system. Possibly under batch oriented CEP topic.
5. **Middle-ware components.md**: this is focus on the system treating un-modified engine as black box. 
6. **ScaleCEP**:other CEP paper related to scalability issue.
