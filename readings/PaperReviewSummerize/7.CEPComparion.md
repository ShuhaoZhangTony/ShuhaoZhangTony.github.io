#Compare Query optimizer on different CEP products
##Questions
### NFA based/query plan tree based?
###Support for multi query optimization?
### Statistics/how to perform cost estimation?

##Literature
###SASE

2. SASE: Complex Event Processing over Streams, CIDR 2007
3. Efficient Pattern Matching over Event Streams, SIGMOD 2008
4. Optimizing Expensive Queries in Complex Event Processing, SIGMOD 2014
####Answers
1. NFA based. The optimizer is built to optimize one query at one time. Methods include: 
	1. Sharing intermediate results between *Runs*(noted, this is a special concept in CEP, and it means a *potential matched pattern sequence*.
	2. partition active stack.
	3. postpone filtering for **Kleene closure pattern queries**.
2. No.
3. It does not provide a cost model. Heuristic only.

######Remark: The contribution from SASE is that they are the first to proposed CEP product, (Before that, the closest concept is ESP) . And they are also the first proposed NFA based model on execution the CEP. They are also the best in optimizing single query in CEP.

###Cayuga

2. Towards Expressive Publish/Subcribe Systems, EDBT 2006
3. Cayuga: A General Purpose Event Monitoring System, CIDR 2007
####Answers
1. NFA based. The original engine is built from publish/subscribe system, which has an emphasize on multi-query optimization.
2. Yes, it support MQO by using three techniques:state merging, automaton indexing, channel, please find my detail study report for this.
3. It does not provide a cost model. Heuristic only. (Mentioned in the original paper[1], leave as future work)

######Remark: The main contribution lays on they are the first who consider extending publish-subscribe system into CEP, the good thing for publish-subscribe system is it naturally support multi-query optimization, while CEP doesn't.

###ZStream

ZStream: A Cost-based Query Processor for Adaptively Detecting Composite Events, SIGMOD 2009
####Answers
1. query plan tree based, it will optimize every single query based on its cost model.
2. No.
3. It provided a cost model, described in Section 5 of original paper.
>
In traditional databases, the estimated cost of a query
plan consists of I/O and CPU costs. In ZStream, **I/O cost
is not considered** because all primitive events are memory
resident. ZStream computes CPU cost for each operator
from three terms: 
	
	1. the cost to access the input data, 
	2. the cost of predicate evaluation 
	3. and the cost to generate the output data.
These costs are measured as the number of input
events accessed and the number of output events combined.

The cost C = Ci + (nk)Ci + pCo
Please find detail in the original paper, quite easy to understand.
######Remark: Obviously, they are the first to propose cost model into CEP.
###Hp-Chaos(WPI)
I put HP-Chaos in literature section because I didn't find any HP-Chaos product in marketing, the top CEP products in market are: **IBM System S, SAP ESP, Software AG Amada.** According to Forrest marketing report 2014.

####Answers
1. Not available ? suspected to be NFA based. Since he mentioned "Stack based CEP". The optimizer will compute and generate the best overall execution plan for a set of queries based on its cost model.
2. Yes, actually E-cube is the state-of-the-art in the topic of "MQO on CEP".
3. Yes, It provides cost-model for each MQO optimization strategies.

the following is the cost model for ***General to Specific with Pattern Changes***:

Similarly, GtoS with concept changes and StoG etc are also provided.
######Remark: *Refinement* used in the paper is refer to simultaneously concept and pattern changes, then select minimum cost among two. The contribution is obviously they are the first to really study MQO on CEP, Cayuga also considered MQO on CEP, but they simply ignored the fact that CEP need to consider multiple different sequence queries (not only different filtering conditions).

##Industry
###Esper
I put Esper here, because it's the top open-source CEP product, many commercial CEP product are built from it's core engine.
####Related papers
1. A Middleware Platform to Federate Complex Event Processing, IEEE International EDOC Conference, 2012
####Answers
1. It's a mix style, look at these two claims from it's official document:
	1. The EPL pattern engine does not employ NFA, it is a based on dynamic state trees where branches (active pattern sub-expressions) create and destroy.
	2. The match-recognize pattern matching functionality is built using nondeterministic finite automata (NFA).   
2. Esper uses indexes, a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations. For sorted access it may prefer a binary tree index while a hash-based index is great for key lookups.
For efficient matching of incoming events to statements the engine uses inverted indexes.

	> Index is broadly used in publish-subscribe system, Esper support both ESP and CEP, thus no wonder to find index support. 
	> Interestingly, Esper only publish benchmark for ESP style queries, CEP style query benchmark is not provided yet.

3. No cost model mentioned.
###SAP ESP
####Related papers
No.
####Answers
1. It's a mix style, since it support both ESP and CEP.
2. Very limited support, the optimizer will generate the best execution strategy(CCX) for a given CCL project(may include multiple queries), automatic partition and parallelism is the focus of this optimizer. But it does have mentioned "Sharing intermediate results among queries", for instance, if two queries defined same window, then they can share this window.
3. No cost model mentioned. suspected to be heuristic based.
###IBM System S
####Related papers
1. Partition and Compose:Parallel Complex Event Proecessing, DEBS 2012 
2. IBM Streams Processing Language: Analyzing Big Data in motion, 
####Answers
1. It's automata style.
2. Possible not at all, at least not ever mentioned. The optimizer focus on program efficiency, besides, they also put main efforts on partition and parallelism.
3. No cost model mentioned.

##Summarize
From the above study, we can see that, only limited projects in literature mentioned/tried Multi-query optimization on CEP, in industry prospective, no existing product support MQO on CEP, instead, their optimizer focuses on partition and parallelism.

The query optimizer for SAP ESP and IBM System S is the same level, and they represent the top CEP product in industry, but they both far behind the state-of-the-art in literature in the topic of Multi-query optimization.
