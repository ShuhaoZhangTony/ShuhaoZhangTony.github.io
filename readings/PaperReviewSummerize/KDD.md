##Sequence analysis
1. In KDD'12, The long and the short of it.. :

	###Problem:
The outcome of standard frequent pattern mining contain **too much redundancy or noise**.
	###Idea:
*Pattern set* mining approach -- an approach where, instead of ranking patterns individually, we consider results as a whole.
2. In Sigmod'14, Resource-oriented Approximation for Frequent Itemset Mining from Busty Data Streams:
	###Problem:
	Handling a huge combinatorial number of entries (i.e., itemsets) to be generated from each streaming transaction and stored in memory.

	Various types of existing approximation algorithms require **at most O(2^L)** space for the maximal length L of transactions.

	In some case, the transaction is extremely long (L is large), memory overflow is very likely to happen.

	###Solutions:
