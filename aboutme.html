<h1>Something More About Me</h1>   
<hr/>    

<pre >
  Something that I'm so proud of myself has nothing to do with the education awards that I have obtained, nor any research achievement awards that I have received so far. 
  I'm so proud of myself being <b>honest</b>, that I do all my homework and lab sessions by myself even after an incident where my labmate (team of two) "borrowed" code from seniors and use them to get high marks for the lab and told the lecturer behind my back that I contributed nothing and I got zero marks;
  I'm so proud of myself being <b>diligent</b>, that I worked hard by reading papers, writing code, and living in a laboratory (PDCC@NTU) day and night when I found myself lacking in many techniques and research skills. I even used tissue paper to cover my glasses for an eye, became ill because of too tired, and use the remaining one to continue studying;
  I'm so proud of myself being <b>dedicated</b>, that I was not jealous to give up my career plan when my classmates jeering me for getting a low salary upon graduation because I opt for a PhD instead of going to banks like most of my classmates;
  I'm so proud of myself being <b>tenacious</b>, that I re-do all experiments and re-write one of my papers from scratch after it being rejected four times. There were tears sometimes, of course, but tears can be easily wipe off and life continues...
