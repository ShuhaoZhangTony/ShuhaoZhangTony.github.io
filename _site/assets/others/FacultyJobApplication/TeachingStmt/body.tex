I strongly believe in teaching rigorous fundamentals that transcend the ad-hoc technological fads of the moment. 
There are many fancy techniques nowadays, just taking data processing systems as an example, there are Apache Storm, Flink, Spark-streaming, Heron, Google Millwheel etc.
Beginners often struggle with which one to pick up. 
I always emphasize to people who seek help from me that the specifics of which software, libraries, programming languages are evolve at a rapid pace, and they can be easily pick up on the job once they have developed strong foundations. 
Taking myself as an example, I analysis fundamental design decisions of popular data stream processing systems and summarize them into three key aspects~\cite{profile}. With those analysis, I know how those systems works and even how they may evolve.
