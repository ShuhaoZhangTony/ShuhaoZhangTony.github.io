\paragraph{Example Courses}
I look forward to teaching courses related to database, software engineering, and large scale data processing system in general. 

I would like to create new courses related to my research focus, such as:
\begin{myenumerate}
\item big data processing system design and implementation
\item hardware-conscious algorithms and systems.
\end{myenumerate}
