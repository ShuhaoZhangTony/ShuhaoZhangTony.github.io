I am a system researcher with a computer science background in database design and software engineering. 
My research strives to build next generation of DSPSs and algorithms towards more efficient and scalable by exploiting the more and more widely accessible powerful hardware devices. 
For example, the system that I have built so far, for the first time, scales stream computation towards hundred of cores under the Non-Uniform-Memory-Access effect~\cite{briskstream}. 
This brings the potential of accelerating existing stream processing application beyond what can be achieved today, and brings many new opportunities of supporting emerging data-intensive applications, such as online big-data machine learning.

In the coming years, 
I plan to further explore new optimization opportunities that improves the state-of-the-art approaches in managing big data streams including both more efficient systems and algorithms. 
This brings research interests involving not only system but also application research, and has the potential to make large impact in both academic and industry community.
In the following, I will summary my past key research activities, which are first-authored published in top-tier conference in the database community. 
Beyond that, I have also first-authored two patents~\cite{zhang2018efficient,zhang2018multi} registered in US based on my past research results, which indicates the large potential of industry and society impact of my research.
I will end this article with my future research plans.
