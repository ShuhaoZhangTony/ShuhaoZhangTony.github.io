<p> 
Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) (<a href="http://www.sutd.edu.sg/index.aspx">Link</a>) is the fourth autonomous university of Singapore, set up in collaboration with MIT and Zhejiang University. <br>
SUTD is among <b>"four emerging learders"</b> in engineering education globally -- MIT New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET), 2018 (<a href="https://jwel.mit.edu/assets/document/global-state-art-engineering-education">Link</a>)<br>
Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) Pillar of SUTD (<a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/">Link</a>): We offer enriching computing education that includes a full-time undergraduate degree programme, PhD programme and a full-time/part-time Masters programme.<br>
Ranked globally <b>51</b> in Best Universities for Computer Science – usnews, 2020 (<a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/singapore-university-of-technology-design-529432">Link</a>). <br>

<h2>Research Direction </h2> 
<div class="contentWrap">
<p> 
	Data stream processing is a hot topic. It is a technique allowing users to process infinite data streams in real time. It is nowadays a buzzy word appearing almost everywhere because of internet of things, 5G, real time AI, etc.
	To cope with the fast increasing application demand, many stream processing systems have been proposed in the last decades, such as Storm, Flink, Spark-streaming, and so on. 
	<br>
	My research generally involves two aspects: 1) architecting novel stream processing systems & algorithms and 2) implementing novel stream processing applications (e.g., online machine learning, trajectory analytics and so on). 
	<br>
	If you are interested in a topic in this area, please, provide me with some information about you, your interests, your programming skills, and your CV.
</p> 

 
<p> Current running projects (each project will be allocated 2-3 PhD students and 1-2 postdocs):</p> 
	<ol>
	    <li> <b>[Sesame]</b>: we will build a novel data stream management system to support emerging complex applications such as real time fraud detection with reinforcement learning. <br>
	    	<ul>
		     <li> Those applications are hard, if not impossible, to be supported by conventional stream processing engines or ML/database systems. </li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
<!--	    <li> <b>Smart Timeseries Database</b>: we will build an AI-driven timeseries management system to smartly support timeseries storage and analytics. <br>
		    <ul>
		     <li> We will revisit every corner of the design of modern timeseries database with novel techniques including AI, Modern Hardware (e.g., GPGPU, FPGA, etc.).  </li>
		   </ul>
	    </li>
--> 	    
	    <li> 
	    	More projects to be announced.

<h2>Remuneration</h2> 
<div class="contentWrap">
<p> 
Tuition fee is fully covered, up to 3000 SGD stipends per month. 
For good students, I can recommend them to exchange (in their senior years)/work (after graduate) in both acadamic or industry such as TU Berlin, SAP Walldorf, A*Star, etc.
