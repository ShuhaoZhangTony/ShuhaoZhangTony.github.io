<h2>Research Direction </h2> 
<div class="contentWrap">
<ul> 
	<li>
		Data stream processing is a hot topic. It is a technique allowing users to process infinite data streams in real time. It is nowadays a buzzy word appearing almost everywhere because of internet of things, 5G, real time AI, etc. To cope with the fast increasing application demand, many stream processing systems have been proposed in the last decades, such as Storm, Flink, Spark-streaming, and so on. 
	</li>
	<li>
		My research generally involves two aspects: 1) architecting novel stream processing systems & algorithms and 2) implementing novel stream processing applications (e.g., online machine learning, trajectory analytics and so on). 
	</li>
</ul> 

 
<p> Current running projects (each project will be allocated 2-3 PhD students and 1-2 postdocs):</p> 
	<ol>
	    <li> <b>[Sesame]</b>: we will build a novel data stream management system to support emerging complex applications such as real time fraud detection with reinforcement learning. <br>
	    	<ul>
		     <li> Those applications are hard, if not impossible, to be supported by conventional stream processing engines or ML/database systems. </li>
     		     <li> Required Skills: well-understanding of machine learning and data mining algorithms/techniques, skillful in system development. </li>
     		     <li> Related Work: "SAMOA: Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis", "Real-time Event Detection on Social Data Streams". </li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
	    <li> <b>[TStream]</b>: we will build a mordern hardware-conscious full-fledged transactional stream processing system. <br>
		    <ul>
		     <li> We will revisit every corner of the design of modern TSP system with novel techniques including AI, Modern Hardware (e.g., GPGPU, FPGA, etc.).  </li>
		     <li> Required Skills: well-understanding of transactional stream processing, skillful in system development, at least skillfull in one hardware architecture (multicore CPU, GPU, FPGA etc). </li>
     		     <li> Related Work: "Towards Concurrent Stateful Stream Processing on Multicore Processors". </li>
		   </ul>

<!--
Detailed available topics:

1.     Transactional Stream Processing System

In this topic, you will work on TStream [1], a recently proposed stream processing system supporting concurrent stateful stream processing. You can choose to enhance the system from multiple aspects: 1) efficiently supporting of transaction abortion; 2) more scalable indexing technique; and 3) more efficient way of handling data-dependencies among state transactions. 

2.      Secure and Private Stream Processing

In this topic, you will work on Intel SGX [2] and/or Homomorphic Encryption (HE) [3] mechanism to support secure and private stream processing. The goal is to investigate how to efficiently implement some of the important stream processing operations (e.g., stream join, window aggregation) in Intel SGX and/or with HE scheme.

3.     Progressive and Interactive Applications

In this topic, you will implement novel stream applications on one of the stream processing systems such as Storm/Flink/Spark-Streaming. The goal is to investigate how to better support applications such as online machine learning/data mining [4], fast trajectory exploration [5] and so on.
