I have long been committed to diversity, and recognize the barriers faced by women and other minorities in engaging in studying and research. 
While as a undergraduate student, I participated in my university’s peer-coach program to engage peer students who have significant lag behind the majority in GPAs. 
I volunteered to work with two students for 10 weeks, and met with them regularly. 
I worked hard to give them a positive and welcoming experience in how to make better progress in study. I was awarded ``best peer-coach'' twice from my university during that period~\cite{award}.
