\paragraph{Mentorship\\}
Helping students fulfill their potential to become producers of new knowledge is an indescribably wonderful feeling. 
I first learned to mentor as a research assistant at NUS, where I worked closely with two undergraduates on their trajectory query processing and visualization projects that could formed their undergraduate final-year-project.
I have also learned to supervise one Ph.D. student under Prof. Bingsheng He, working on time-series data management project that may form the basis for his dissertation. 
%led to top-tier HCI publications (at CHI, UIST, and TOCHI, respectively) that formed
%the basis for their dissertation projects.
