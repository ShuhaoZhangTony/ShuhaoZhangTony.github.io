<ul>
	<li>Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) (<a href="http://www.sutd.edu.sg/index.aspx">Link</a>) is the fourth autonomous university of Singapore, set up in collaboration with MIT and Zhejiang University. </li>
	<li>SUTD is among <b>"four emerging learders"</b> in engineering education globally -- MIT New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET), 2018 (<a href="https://jwel.mit.edu/assets/document/global-state-art-engineering-education">Link</a>) </li>
	<li>Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) Pillar of SUTD (<a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/">Link</a>): We offer enriching computing education that includes a full-time undergraduate degree programme, PhD programme and a full-time/part-time Masters programme. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="research-direction">Research Direction</h3>

<ul> 
	<li>Data stream processing is a hot topic. It is a technique allowing users to process infinite data streams in real time. It is nowadays a buzzy word appearing almost everywhere because of internet of things, 5G, real time AI, etc. To cope with the fast increasing application demand, many stream processing systems have been proposed in the last decades, such as Storm, Flink, Spark-streaming, and so on. 
	</li>
	<li>My research generally involves two aspects: 1) architecting novel stream processing systems &amp; algorithms and 2) implementing novel stream processing applications (e.g., online machine learning, trajectory analytics and so on). 
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Current running projects (each project will be allocated 2-3 PhD students and 1-2 postdocs):</p>
<ol>
	<li> <b>[Sesame]</b>: we will build a novel data stream management system to support emerging complex applications such as real time fraud detection with reinforcement learning. <br />
	    	<ul>
		     <li> Those applications are hard, if not impossible, to be supported by conventional stream processing engines or ML/database systems. </li>
     		     <li> Required Skills: well-understanding of machine learning/data mining/graph algorithms/techniques, skillful in system development. </li>
     		     <li> Related Work: "SAMOA: Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis, JMLR 2015", "Real-time Event Detection on Social Data Streams, KDD 2019", "Sub-millisecond Stateful Stream Querying over Fast-evolving Linked Data, SOSP 2017" </li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
	    <li> <b>[TStream]</b>: we will build a novel hardware-conscious full-fledged transactional stream processing system. <br />
		    <ul>
		     <li> We will revisit every corner of the design of modern TSP system with novel techniques including AI, Modern Hardware (e.g., GPGPU, FPGA, etc.).  </li>
		     <li> Required Skills: well-understanding of transactional stream processing, skillful in system development, at least skillfull in one hardware architecture (multicore CPU, GPU, FPGA etc). </li>
     		     <li> Related Work: "BriskStream: Scaling Data Stream Processing on Shared-Memory Multicore Architectures, SIGMOD 2019", "Towards Concurrent Stateful Stream Processing on Multicore Processors, ICDE 2020". </li>
		   </ul>
	    </li>
	    
	<li> More projects to be announced.
