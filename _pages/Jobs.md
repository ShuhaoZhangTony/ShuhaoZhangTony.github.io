### School Information

<ul>
	<li>Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) (<a href="http://www.sutd.edu.sg/index.aspx">Link</a>) is the fourth autonomous university of Singapore, set up in collaboration with MIT and Zhejiang University. </li>
	<li>SUTD is among <b>"four emerging learders"</b> in engineering education globally -- MIT New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET), 2018 (<a href="https://jwel.mit.edu/assets/document/global-state-art-engineering-education">Link</a>) </li>
	<li>Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) Pillar of SUTD (<a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/">Link</a>): We offer enriching computing education that includes a full-time undergraduate degree programme, PhD programme and a full-time/part-time Masters programme. </li>
</ul>

### Research Direction

<ul> 
	<li>Data stream processing is a hot topic. It is a technique allowing users to process infinite data streams in real time. It is nowadays a buzzy word appearing almost everywhere because of internet of things, 5G, real time AI, etc. To cope with the fast increasing application demand, many stream processing systems have been proposed in the last decades, such as Storm, Flink, Spark-streaming, and so on. 
	</li>
	<li>My research generally involves two aspects: 1) architecting novel stream processing systems &amp; algorithms and 2) implementing novel stream processing applications (e.g., online machine learning, trajectory analytics and so on). 
	</li>
</ul>
