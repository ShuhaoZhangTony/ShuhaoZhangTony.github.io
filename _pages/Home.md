I obtained the Ph.D. degree from the school of computing at <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> in 2019 and the Bachelor degree with first-class honours from the school of computer engineering at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a> in 2014.
My current research interest include big data management systems (with special interests in stream processing and timeseries management), distributed and parallel computing and emerging ML/AI applications.
