Prior to joining SUTD, I was a <em>Postdoc Researcher</em> at <a href="https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/staff/">DIMA Technische Universität Berlin</a> working with <a href="https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/staff/volker_markl/">Prof.Volker Markl</a>. I obtained the Ph.D. degree from the school of computing at <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> in 2019 (supervised by <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/">Prof.Bingsheng He</a>) and the Bachelor degree with first-class honours from the school of computer engineering at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a> in 2014.
My current research interest include big data management systems (with special interests in stream processing and timeseries management), distributed and parallel computing and emerging ML/AI applications.
