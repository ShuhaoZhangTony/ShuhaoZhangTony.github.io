[Service] I serve as a PC member for Autonomic Solutions for Parallel and Distributed Data Stream Processing (<a href="http://calvados.di.unipi.it/auto-dasp-21/" Auto-DaSP 2021 </a>). The workshop tries to attract submissions in the field of new run-time systems for Data Stream Processing on emerging architectures, with a special emphasis this year on performance evaluation.
